            <h3>Riad Hossen Riko</h3>

            <p>
                I have been working as a freelance web developer & designer since 2022. I’ve always been someone who has
                both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web devolopment in college, I realized it would be
                the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code. As a bonus, being
                both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.

            <h2>I love working with small businesses</h2>
            <p>
                I specialize in creating sites for individuals and small businesses. You shouldn’t have to settle for
                cheap solutions or generic templates. I provide custom designs at afforable prices. Frequently your
                website is the first impression your customers will get, so make sure it’s a good one. Since my time is
                split between a few different things, I’m not able to take on every project I’d like to, but I'm always
                looking for fun work. Take a look at my portfolio below, if you think I’d be a good match send me an
                email.

                    function, efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript
                    framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
                    100% web solution.
